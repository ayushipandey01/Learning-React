# React Web App to diplay User's detail

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

## About this Project
The application is build to first login via a form and then fetching the user dummy API to display the data. I have also implemented the searching functionality based on the username. Moreover , one can also click on "Show details" button and a Modal will pop up showing the basic details of the user.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
